# Homebrew Automation üçª

This is a project to automate the installation of all the apps I like to have on my macbook

## Getting Started

1. Copy project files to a file on your desktop named "install"
2. Run install.sh in terminal using:
	```
	sh Desktop/install/install.sh
	```

### Prerequisites

To install apps from mac app store you need to be signed into the mac app store with an apple id.


### To Note

Some apps eg Virtaul Box will trigger a prompt to allow accessability settings. This may cause a homebrew install failure but install will be sucsessful if you accept the promt.


## Built With

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - MacOs Package Manager
* [Mas-Cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) - Mac App Store command line interface
